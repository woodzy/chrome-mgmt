# chrome-mgmt

Simple scripts to manage the chrome data sandbox. Intended to be used for isolating browser data instances (cookies) and reduce the potential for tracking. 

The -edit-profile scripts must be run first to create a base profile and configure with plugins intended.

Your encouraged to keep this directory in a local git repo in order to better manage changes to the profiles.
